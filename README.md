## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

This first challenge helped me refresh my knowledge of HTML and CSS, since I have been studying JS for about 2 months and had forgotten to practice HTML and CSS.

It also helped me practice creating a project from scratch with React and webpack.

### Continued development

My focus is to continue learning and building in React and Nextjs
